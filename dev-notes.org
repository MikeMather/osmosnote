* How to handle link insertion?
- use clipboard as much as possible
- when pasting, autoformat entire note

* How to handle reference (book, website, podcast)?
- if a book points existing ideas, link to them
- if a book generates multiple new idea, capture the book, then capture individual ideas, and point from book to those ideas
  - May require an "extra paragraph as idea" workflow
