1. Make sure nvm is properly exposing `npx` in login shell
2. Put content of the `app` folder somewhere in the system. Make sure the script is executable
3. Put the content of the `desktop` folder on the desktop
4. Adjust the `Exec` and `Icon` path in `osmosnote.desktop` to point to the content of the `app`
5. In Gnome, right click the `.desktop` and choose `Allow Launching`. Note, this is NOT the same as `chmod +x`.
